📧 Unified Gmail AI Assistant
Enterprise‑Grade AI Email Triage, Smart Reply Generation & Notion Sync — DWDA‑Ready

🚀 Executive Summary
The Unified Gmail AI Assistant is a next‑generation, multilingual AI platform for automated enterprise email management.
It connects directly to Google Workspace Gmail using Domain‑Wide Delegation (DWDA) — eliminating manual OAuth approvals for each user and enabling scalable, organization‑wide deployment.

Seamlessly integrated with Notion for centralized tracking, reporting, and collaboration, the assistant handles the entire lifecycle of email triage — from summarization and intent detection to multilingual reply drafting, tone analysis, and confidence scoring.

Designed for internal enterprise automation today, with a roadmap toward SaaS scalability tomorrow.

✨ Key Capabilities
📥 Gmail Enterprise Integration — Securely fetches & processes last 7 days of inbox emails via DWDA (no manual logins)

🧠 Multilingual AI Summarization — GPT‑4 summaries generated in the same language as the email

📌 Business Intent Detection — Recognizes 40+ predefined business commands across Sales, Support, HR, Legal, and Operations

✍️ Dual AI Reply Drafts — Produces formal & friendly multilingual drafts, ready for quick send or team editing

🎯 Tone & Confidence Scoring — Analyzes sentiment and assigns AI certainty scores for each message

🏷 Department Auto‑Tagging — Intelligent routing to relevant teams (Sales, Support, HR, Legal, Ops, or General)

🗃 Notion Database Sync — Creates structured Notion entries for every processed email for audit & collaboration

🌐 Deployment‑Ready Backend — Flask API + dashboard interface; deployable to Render, Cloud Run, or internal infrastructure

🔒 Enterprise‑Grade Security — All secrets stored in .env, fully excluded from GitHub via .gitignore
